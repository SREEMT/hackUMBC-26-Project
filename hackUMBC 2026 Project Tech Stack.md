### Party/Rave management app
- Social app designed around building a subculture (for raves)
- Designed to keep the culture while also bringing in people who fit in.
- System to gatekeep locations unless they pass a pre screen
- Guest system, people can bring a certain amount of guests based on the organizers
- Organizers can manage past attendees to their events and change screening status.
- Subscription system to give more features to organizers
- Feature to add other people as “bouncers” that check people’s screening and tickets all in the app.
- Organizers and bouncers can add notes under attendees for future or current use or they can flag them for any future events.
- Performers or DJs can sign up and put themselves out there. This allows organizers to find DJs or replace any DJs that can't make it last minute. Performers can add a portfolio so organizers can look for what they need.
	- Organizers can sort by music genre.
- Users must use phone & email numbers to create accounts so it's harder to make multiple and avoid flags.
	- Add ID feature later
